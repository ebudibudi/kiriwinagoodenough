<h2>The Office of the Member for Kiriwina Goodenough supplies medicine and food to the district</h2>
<h3>09 May 2020</h3>
</hgroup><p>"My office continues to do what it can do to assist my people amid the covid-19 pandemic", said the local MP Hon. D.Tomuriesa as
            he was responding to critics on social media. He mentioned, apart from his ongoing priorities such as Education, Health, etc..
            his office continues to make certain, the wellbeing of Kiriwina Goodenough people are safeguarded during the Government's covid-19 SOE. 
         </p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, two chartered flights of medicine were airlifted to the district from Port Moresby.
           This was done after his announcement on social media as quoted "<i>To my good people of Kiriwina Goodenough Ì want
           to assure you all we are doing
           our best to stock all drugs required for our hospitals and by next week we should have everything up to
           date for the Health Centres down to the Aid Posts.
           Flights carrying all the medical drugs and other necessities have been dispatched starting today, Friday and next week.
           We diverted out attention to this urgent need and we are kindly asking for everyone's understanding in this great time
           of concern.</i>"
       </p>
        <p>Food supplies (bags of rice, bags of flour, tinned stuff, etc..) are loaded in four cargo boats and headed to the district to be
        distributed to the people as part of the KG office's move to assist the district amid this pandemic.</p>

<h2>The Kiriwina Goodenough Scholarships Scheme Continues in 2020 more stronger despite Challenges</h2>
<h3>23rd March 2020</h3>
</hgroup><p>Quality education is everyone’s’ business. The quality of education in Papua New Guinea is determined through standards
            and benchmark. However our education standards has declined over the recent years and benchmark set at certain exit points
            or levels within our system were not achieved and overlooked as that may seem to be the case.  
           In the Education Sector, the Honorable Member has been particularly concerned and triggered his priority
           aligning with the MTDS and Vision 2050 to Human Resource Development within the Kiriwina Goodenough District. 
         </p>
        <p>Despite the many challenges faced by the District, we must not forget what our main priorities are.
           This is what keeps us going as a district. The Honorable Member has been facing a court battle currently, but that has nothing to do with
           the district and its people. The district derseves continuity of services. The KG Scholarship Scheme is the good example. 
           The upcoming first DDA meeting for 2020 will be held at Giva (Kaileuna Island) where the DDA board will officially announce
           and approve some of our main projects to be carried out in 2020 and behond.

<h2>Formal traditional presentation after the Crowning</h2>
<h3>15th June 2016</h3>
</hgroup>
Hon. Tomuriesa's recent visit with his delegates to Goodenough LLG was evidently one of the most important visits he and his delegates
           had ever done over the last four years on the Island. The reception by the people were owesome.</p>
<p>The purpose of the visit was for their Local Hon. Member D. Tomuriesa to officially open various projects his office
   had funded on the Island like Classrooms, community Halls etc... The member also presented cheques for various groups like Goodnough Cocoa Growers
   Cooperatives, and some other community groups.</p>
<p>As a token of great appreciation for what the Member had done to the people of Goodnough, the chiefs and people have decided that
it was fitting they traditionally initiate him by crowning their member to become the true "SON Of Goodenough". That was the moment the people of Goodenough
openly declared they fully support Tomuriesa for what he had done for them for the last 4 years as their local member.</p>
