        <i>Chairman for Kiriwina Goodenough District Development Authority</i>
        </b> </caption>

    <p>It is my distinct honour and privilege to record for the information of persons to whom this website may have purpose to engage with in-depth discourse.
    I am proud to inform our people of Kiriwina Goodenough electorate, the two Local Level Government (LLG) Presidents,
    the Ward Councillors, development partners, stakeholders and friends that Kiriwina Goodenough District Development
    Authority (KGDDA) has now an official website. This website is not only attractive, but it’s interactive and will
    compare among other websites around the world.</p>

     <p>This is a significant Information & Communication milestone in the history of Kiriwina Goodenough electorate
     which I am proud to be part of. Equally important is the inclusion of the important part of the project <b>
     "the district's emailing system"</b> which will serve our people to connect with our district's administration for any quiries they wish to ask.
     The whole project will further enhance collaboration amongst electoral staff, public servants, support staff and our people sharing similar interests working towards
     the electorates common goals. This marks yet another milestone in the electorates’ endeavours to contribute to social transformation and
     development of our District by sharing with the rest of the world important information and initiatives of the
     KGDDA. </p>

    <p>The KGDDA website is initiated to inform our people, our stakeholders, our development partners our vision
    (both Local and abroad) about what we have done for Kiriwina Goodenough since we took office over seven (7) years ago
    and also what we have planned to address in the years ahead.</p>

    <p>The website is an important tool to be used to disseminate information to its stakeholders in and out of Kiriwina
    Goodenough electorate. It will be a source of information for our people, students, teachers, public servants,
    development partners, stakeholders from in-country and abroad.</p>

    <p>This website we now have is a modern piece of work which has been developed using modern technologies.
    It is designed to meet the expectations of investors, researchers, students, public servants and the general public.
    It endeavours to provide information on various social and developmental programs which includes;
    the church government partnership program, health, education and scholarship program, household roofing
    and solar lighting program, infrastructure, tourism, community engagements initiatives and virtually captures all
    activities that the electorate engages in on daily basis. This will increase traffic as more users will find the
    site valuable hence marketing the electorate will be a lot easier.</p>

   <p>Moreover, this website has several links including social media pages thus enabling everyone including the
   broader public to communicate and find information from the electorate instantaneously.
   
  <p>I would like to applaud people who are behind this project specifically Emmanuel Budibudi who initially took his
  own time to develop this important system for the electorate. These kinds of initiatives are what our electorate
  needs towards realisation of its visions and I would like to challenge all elites to come up with innovative
  projects for the advancement of our Kiriwina Goodenough electorate, Milne Bay Province and the country as a whole.
  </p>

  <p>I wish to thank one and all for finding time to surf this website. Please continue to join hands with the
  Government to strengthen our electorate. Enjoy surfing.</p>

 <p> <b>Thank you, Kagutoki, Siule la kaina </b></p>
